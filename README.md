📌 Project Title
"AI-Powered Audio & Video Processing Web Application (Flask)" – [View Project]([https://github.com/YourUsername/flask-audio-video-app](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iyEcVi5eIUq99YJ-uY1R1-Cvrk388K6g/view?usp=sharing))

🛠 Before Starting this Project
Before starting, you need to:

Install Python and required libraries (Flask, pyttsx3, speechrecognition, moviepy, fpdf, python-docx, cryptography, pydrive2, google-cloud-speech, assemblyai, etc.).

Have Google Cloud API credentials for Speech-to-Text and Google Drive integration.

Have an AssemblyAI API key for speaker identification.

Create a Google Drive folder for uploading files from the app.

Install ffmpeg for video and audio processing.

📝 What is this Project?
This is a Flask-based web application that allows users to work with audio and video files in multiple ways. You can convert speech to text, convert text to speech, extract audio from video, do real-time transcription, identify speakers, search inside transcripts, edit text, export files in different formats, secure your data, and upload directly to Google Drive.

🎯 Why Need this Project?
To save time in transcription and note-taking.

To analyze audio/video files for meetings, lectures, interviews, etc.

To easily convert between text, audio, and document formats.

To automate uploads to Google Drive for storage and sharing.

To increase productivity for students, professionals, and businesses.
  
  ⚙ How this Project Works
User uploads audio/video/text files or types/pastes text directly.

Depending on the feature selected, the app:

Converts speech to text (from file or real-time microphone input).

Converts text to speech using AI voice.

Extracts audio from video files.

Identifies different speakers in an audio file.

Searches for specific words/phrases inside transcripts.

Allows editing and saving updated transcripts.

Exports text in PDF, DOCX, or TXT format.

Encrypts and decrypts data for privacy and security.

Uploads any file to Google Drive directly.
